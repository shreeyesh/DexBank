# DexBank
A simple Decentralized Banking service, built on solidity that helps you to transfer/withdraw/check_balance of your ethereum.
This code was deployed on Javascript VM, although for further test purposes we can also deploy it on Kovan Test network.
If you want to test it on a testnet(Kovan) firsly you would need to install metamask wallet, later you have to paste your metamask address(Kovan testnet) in chatroom(https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) you will get some eth shortly to test the code.
